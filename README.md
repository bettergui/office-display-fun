# Office Display Fun

Office Display Fun is a collaborative animation coding experiment. Whether you are a seasoned developer or a code-curious bystander, everyone is encouraged to join!

We use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a library for creative coding with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else!

## Get Started

- Send me your github account so I can give you commit access.

- You need `git` to download and update the code. If you are a beginner, install [Github Desktop](https://help.github.com/en/desktop) and use it instead of the command line for any git action.

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:chrisrauh/office-display-fun.git
```

- For image and data loading to work correctly during development, you need to use a [local server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server) - we encourage using the [Web Server for Chrome Extension](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server#web-server-for-chrome-extension) option for simplicity.
